### **Data Description**

The dataset is from the 2017 World Happiness Report (https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2017/) published by the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. This data was collected by the Gallup World Poll, using a set of surveys from more than 160 countries in over 140 languages.
The surveys aim to analyze data from hundreds of thousands of individuals and investigate the ways in which elements of peopleâ€™s working lives drive their wellbeing.

Each country is given a happiness score that is the sum of scores from the following 7 criteria

* GDP per capita
* healthy years of life expectancy
* social support (as measured by having someone to count on in times of trouble)
* trust (as measured by a perceived absence of corruption in government and business)
* perceived freedom to make life decisions
* generosity (as measured by recent donations)
* dystopia (benchmark country corresponding to the lowest possible values in each of the criteria)

The countries are then ranked from most happy to least happy.

Additionally, the report contains information about job satisfaction in each country. 

### **Problem Statement**

The objective here is to investigate the relationships of the above different criteria wrt to the happiness scores.
